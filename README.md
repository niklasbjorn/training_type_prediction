# training_type_prediction
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This tool will be used to analyze data from sportwatches to be able to categorize traning sessions as short, long, interval, tempo or distance types based on their duration and heart rate profiles. 

## Background
I would like for my sportswatch to be able to classify my traning sessions without me having to manually do so.

## How is it used?
From the start it will be as a program run locally on a computer but i hope to be able to make it avalable through the github io server where others could upload their data and get a classification back. 

The program will use the time stamps and hear rate data from from sportswatches and classify it based on predictions made using a set of currated files that have been used for traning the model.

## Data sources and AI methods
The initial training data will be based on files from my own sportswatch. The model will be supervised and likely based on the k-nearest-neighbour-algorithm.

## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?
The next step would be to have the tool directly available on a sportswatch or in a comunity like Strava.

## Acknowledgments
As for now none.
